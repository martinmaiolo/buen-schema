The food is a fantastic fusion between french and moroccan cuisine, greatly achieved and at good prices. The hotel is just beautiful, with its cobalt blue terrace and tasteful decoration, and the owner (a french guy, unfortunately we could not meet his wife) is super nice and fun to talk to. By far the best restaurant we visited in Marrakech, if we ever come back we'll definitely book a room in the hotel."
